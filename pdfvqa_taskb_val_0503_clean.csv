FRR 3443 (pink bars). For all thren strains of X. bisporus, data relating to the following media were replotted from Williams and
Hallsworth (2009): 0.647, 0.653. 0.655ii, 0.656,0.665, 0.670, 0.702ii and 0.714ii a Medium composition and incubation temperatures for
several treatments with common water-activity values differed (that is, 0.65si, 0.655ii, 0.702i, 0.702ii, 0.714i, 0.714ii, 0.79si and 0.79sii;
for details see Supplementary Table S8). The black arrow indicates the lowest water-activity at which growth of sach strain was observed
during an incubation period of six months. The line graph shows extrapolated growth curves plotted using data obtained on the
biologically permissive media only in order to determine the theoretical extent of the water-activity windows for growth of each species;
the yellow dashed line indicates the original water-activity limit for hyphal growth of the most xerophilic fungi (Pitt and Christian, 1968).
For growth rate values of >4.0 mm per day, variation was 0.20 mm per day, for those between 0.75 and 4.0 mm per day, variation was
+0.10mm per day, and for those of <0.75 mm per day, variation was +0.040 mm per dav (see Williams and Hallsworth, 2009).
